# Automate Data Cleaning App Created by Sachin Gupta

**Interactive Streamlit App for Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis**

---

## ðŸ”¥ Overview

This project is a **user-friendly, Data cleaning tool** built with Python and Streamlit.  
It allows users to upload any dataset and perform **professional-level cleaning and analysis**, including:  

- Missing value detection and imputation  
- Outlier detection and handling (IQR, Z-score, or custom thresholds)  
- Data visualization with boxplots and distribution plots  
- Preview of dataset statistics for both numeric and categorical columns  
- Interactive controls for choosing cleaning methods  
- Apply changes in a controlled manner with an **Apply button**  

This app is designed to demonstrate **real-world data cleaning workflows** for a data science portfolio.
